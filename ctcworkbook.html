        <h3>Negotiating With Creditors</h3>
        <img id="" src="image/handshake.png" alt="creditcards">
        <p>Many creditors will love to speak with someone who is willing to settle their account.
          Call the company and begin negotiations. Tell them the truth about your financial situation,
          and that you would like help in settling your account. When you talk numbers with them, you are getting
          them to agree to accept less money for paying the account now!
          It may take some time, a lot of phone calls and letters. But it’s worth it to repair your credit.</p>

      <li>Check the dates for accounts more than seven years old. High light and circle all negative remarks.
      <li>Organization and good record keeping is a must. List each creditor on the Count The Cost Debt Sheet<br>

      <li>Apply the corresponding letter which gives an explanation and apology for your negligence.<br>

        It’s okay, just press on and press on and press on. After all, it took time to get bad credit,<br>
        it’s going to take time for the good credit to surface. Be persistent.</li>

    <p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 USC sections 1681a through 1681t, protects you against credit abuse error only,

      negative marks on your credit report and regain your good credit status:</p>
      <h3>The Law says</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You can challenge the accuracy of your credit report any time you want.</li>
        <li>The bureau must investigate anything that you challenge.</li>
        <li>They have 30 days. The period begins when the bureau receives the notice from the consumer.<br>
          The exception to the 30-day rule is: when the consumer sends<br> additional materials within
          the 30-day time period.<br>
          The credit bureau can extend the deadline an extra 15 days.</li>
        <li>If they find any error, it must be promptly deleted from its files and yours.</li>
        <li>If the credit bureau does not confirm the challenged information <br>in a reasonable time frame,

        <li>If the creditor verifies the information is indeed correct and the bureau responds in the allotted time<br>
          the negative marks will remain on your credit report. If you insist that the information is in error,<br>

  <p>Count the Cost was created out of a basic need to help people get control of their bad money habits
    and credit. Through my own ignorance and mistakes, I knew I was led by God to simply share my story.
    To help someone else who might be experiencing the same things. </p>

  <p>How do you choose what to do?
    There is a way that seems right but there is a way that is right. I'm going to expose how the car business
    and other establishments make their money off of unsuspecting people like you and me by using bad credit
    to gain big profits. Today seize control and change your life forever!
    Don't forget to download your CTC credit repair kit as our gift to you.
    To help you do just that and simply "Count the Cost!". God bless you Darrell Carey</p>
