      <p> Remember the what you don't know can't hurt you speech?
        WRONG! What you don't know can hurt you. The ultimate quest of the
        dealership and salesperson is to make as much money off of you as possible
        with the least amount of resistance from you. The less you know the better
        for the company's bottom line. <br><br></p>

      <p><mark><strong>The salesperson</strong></mark> is really one of the people
        whom you’ll meet who is the lowest person in the chain of the heirarchy
        of the sales team!
        Most dealerships are run by a series of managers who are ex-salespeople.
        The chain of command goes something like this:</p><br>

      <ol class="pl-3">
        <li><mark><strong>The Owner:</strong></mark> bka, dealer principle. Like Roth Mills Shever Le'.
          He is the moneyman!</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>The General Mgr-GM:</strong></mark> is hired by the owner to oversee the entire
          dealership, managers, sales department, finance department,
          service department, body shop, detail and cleanup department,
          and business office.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>General Sales Mgr-GSM:</strong></mark> runs the managers and governs the sales department.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>Sales Mgr:</strong></mark> runs the sales force and trains the salespeople.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>F & I Mgr:</strong></mark> arranges financing with banks and lending institutions.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>Used car mgr:</strong></mark> Appraises trade ins and buys used cars for
          dealerships to sell.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>Closer:</strong></mark> veteran salesperson or even a manager whose skilled in
          persuading you to buy.</li><br>
        <li><mark><strong>Salesperson:</strong></mark> trained to demonstrate, drive,
          and sell automobiles to consumers.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This team is well trained. They study
        videos, take test, listen to audio and computer training, and
        attend seminars to equip them with the information necessary
        to successfully sell automobiles.  <br><br></p>

      <mark><strong>THE SALESPERSON’S STRATEGY</strong></mark><br><br>
      <p class="text-center">Here are the steps to selling you a car:</p><br>

      <ul class=" list-unstyled pl-3">
        <li>The Smile and the Handshake</li>
        <li>Information Interview</li>
        <li>Pick One</li>
        <li>Walk around Demonstration</li>
        <li>Test Drive Validation</li>
        <li>Proposal to Purchase (4 square!)</li>
        <li>Credit Report and other Paperwork</li>
        <li>The Dance; Negotiating the numbers!</li>
        <li>The Service Walk</li>
        <li> T.O. or turn over the sale to the closer!</li>
      </ul>

      <p><mark><strong>The Smile & Handshake:</strong></mark> This first
        step is designed to gain control over you. The salesperson will attempt
        to establish common ground with you and create a bond of trust. Now that
        your guard is down, the next series of moves are strategically
        developed as a well-planned chess match. The goal is check and mate,
        game over!</p>

      <p>Some salespeople are pushy while others are gentle. Some are honest
        while others are liars. What’s amazing is that most salespeople are
        taught to believe that you are lying to them. One of the slogans I was
        taught is that buyers are liars! When I
        heard it I thought that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Especially
        by so-called
        professionals. Then why do business with a liar?  <br><br>

        This awesome reference is designed to help you with knowledge of the car
        business and reveal their tricks, schemes and strategies.</p><br>

          <p><mark><strong>Count the Cost</strong></mark> was created out of a basic
            need to help people get control of their bad money habits
            and credit. Through my own ignorance, mistakes and knowledge
            I knew I was led by God to simply share my story and experiences.
            To help someone else who might be experiencing the same things.</p><br>

          <p><mark><strong>There is a way</strong></mark>
            that seems right but there is a way that is right. I'll
            share how businesses and establishments make their money
            off of unsuspecting people like you and me. By using bad credit
            to gain big profits.
